This is a Mono/.NET binding for FUSE.

Short HOWTO:

Within one terminal:
	sudo /sbin/modprobe fuse  # need FUSE kernel module to use.
	./configure
	make
	cd example/HelloFS
	mkdir t
	./hellofs t

Within another terminal
	cd example/HelloFS
	ls t
	cat t/hello

This should display files controlled by HelloFS.exe.

To unmount the filesystem, you need to use the `fusermount' program:
	cd example/HelloFS
	fusermount -u t

KILLING THE FUSE PROGRAM IS NOT ENOUGH.  The program will die, but 
FUSE and the kernel will still think that the directory is mounted.
Result: you can't remount the directory, and trying to do anything
with it will result in IO errors.

For full trace output, set the MONO_TRACE_LISTENER environment 
variable and add the -odebug command-line argument:

	cd example/HelloFS
	MONO_TRACE_LISTENER=Console.Out### ./hellofs -odebug t

MONO_TRACE_LISTENER controls the Mono.Fuse trace output, while 
-odebug controls the libfuse-generated trace output.

`hellofs' also takes its own command-line aruments.  By default, 
it exports two files, `data' and `hello'.  `hello' contains the 
string "Hello World!", while `data' is a 100 MB (base 10) file that 
generates its content on-demand.

If you pass the --data.im-in-memory flag, a `data.im' file will be 
available which is a 100MB (base 10) file with the same contents as 
`data', but it is backed by a 100MB byte[] instead of generating its 
contents on demand:

	cd example/HelloFS
	./hellofs --data.im-in-memory t

The 100MB byte[] is allocated the first time the contents of 
`data.im' are read.

`data.im' is useful to see the difference in performance between
generate-on-demand and cached behaviors:

	cd example/HelloFS
	./hellofs --data.im-in-memory t

	# On-demand copy
	time cp t/data f.txt
		real    0m8.469s
		user    0m0.020s
		sys     0m1.128s
	
	# In-memory copy
	# Note that the first `data.im' access is longer
	# because it needed to allocate the array.
	# Subsequent calls are shorter:
	time \cp -f t/data.im f.txt
		real    0m12.393s
		user    0m0.004s
		sys     0m1.172s
	time \cp -f t/data.im f.txt
		real    0m5.233s
		user    0m0.016s
		sys     0m1.136s
	
	# And for comparison, cp without FUSE:
	time cp f.txt f2.txt
		real    0m10.252s
		user    0m0.016s
		sys     0m1.000s

And yes, on my machine it's faster to go through FUSE than to go 
through the filesystem (though usually the filesystem outperforms 
the on-demand generation).  My machine is probably misconfigured. :-/
Your mileage will vary.
